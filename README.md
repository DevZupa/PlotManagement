PlotManagement
==============
By Zupa and Rosska85<br><br>

Installation
============
**Non Plot for Life**<br>
[Instructions found here] (https://github.com/DevZupa/PlotManagement/blob/master/Modded_Epoch.md)<br>
**If you're running Plot for Life**<br>
[Instructions found here] (https://github.com/DevZupa/PlotManagement/blob/master/P4L_Epoch.md)<br><br>

These instructions are pretty much identical, but PlotForLife uses a different variable for owners which persists through death.

Features
========
- Allows the owner to add other players to the plot pole so the player no longer needs to be online for their friend to build at their plot
- Added players can add other players to the plot pole
- Added players can remove other players from the plot pole (**if using Plot for Life, owner cannot be removed**)
- Added players can upgrade all objects in range of the plot pole
- Added players can build anything inside of the plot pole radius (except other plot poles obviously)
- Added players can remove any object inside the plot pole radius
- (**If not using Plot For Life**) Player can add their own UID to the plot pole when they first build it so they don't lose access if they die
- Added players will retain access **even after death**, so if you don't want people building/removing any more at your plot pole, you need to remove their access!
